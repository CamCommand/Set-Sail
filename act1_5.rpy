    "Washing up on a rocky shore after that night doesn’t feel thematically appropriate."

    "A part of me hoped the dingy would be shredded by a whirlpool in a reef somewhere. That way I wouldn’t have to come up with a plan"

    "But here I am."

    "On some beach somewhere."

    "Not sure where, but I hope it isn’t South America. I haven’t spoken Spanish in five years at least."

    "Although, if I’m in America, I could be arrested if I’m found out I’m from the Red Plague."

    "Is there even a point acknowledging the worst night of my life?"

    "How long do I have to just sit with it before moving on?"

    "Poseidon has brought me to shore, what is his plan for me? There’s nothing left."

    "I wonder if anyone else made it out?"

    "I heard Iron Hip yell first under the deck. He must have emptied the entire clip before his screams stopped."

    "JoJo easily could overpower three grown adults, but based on Flavio’s..."

    "Based on how I found Flavio I don’t think they were playing fair."

    "Yet nobody but me will remember their last moments. Their crimes will be revered but them as people will be forgotten."

    "It’s unbelievable that the Captain saved me. Why would he let me go free?"

    "He told me to keep pirating, but what does he want me to do? What is there left for me to do?"

    "I wish I had grabbed some rations."

    "Before finding something to eat, there’s something that needs to be done."

    n "The most important tenets of Anarchy are as follows. Freedom, the rejection of hierarchies, and fairness for all."

    n "These pillars stand proud in the Pirate Code. The rules every good pirate lived by and what every great pirate dies by. Where everyone gets a fair shake at life. This life. This way of being, it’s not an easy one."

    n "The world has rejected us pirates for thousands of years, but we kept fighting to stay alive and to stay free. We didn’t disappear into history books, we continued to cripple the legs of high society."

    n "Enraging our enemies and strengthening our own bonds. \"A pirate’s life for me!\" is what we all said in unison in the face of a crazy world that didn’t make sense to us."

    n "This saying shortens our lifespan but enhances our lives. This was a sacrifice we all took on willingly. My comrades paid the ultimate price for their choices, and in the end, I bet they were happy."

    n "They achieved the happiness they sought out for, is that not a reason to celebrate their lives? Celebrate the lives of the freest people on both sides of the equator?"

    n "Simply believing that is true wouldn’t suffice if I hadn't lived it along with them. I will live the rest of my life, celebrating theirs."

    n "Whenever I’m eating food that doesn’t taste like wood I’ll remember Donatello who could spice up a turd to make it a blessing from Gods"

    n "Everytime I draw a pistol I’ll remember Iron Hip, who could empty a gun into an enemy's chest faster than anyone I ever knew."

    n " I’ll never forget how ol’ Two Hands used both his hands in every task he did, no matter the risks. His efficiency was immeasurable."

    nvl clear

    n "And most of all, I’ll remember my Captain and his ideology of brutal honor down to his very last moment. I will take the lessons you all taught me and carry them to my own end."

    n "Until Posideon deems it to be my final act, I will continue your legacy. May you all find be guided to the afterlife with safety and peace."

    n "This grave itself cannot express the size of the loss, but it represents more than anyone will ever understand. The Red Plague and it’s crew will power though into eternity by my hands. Thank you for everything Captain."

    "Hopefully this will be enough for them. Let's try to find out where I washed up."

    "I should turn my shirt inside out, it just occurred to me how much blood has seeped into it."

    "Don’t think any of it is mine, thankfully. Nobody will let me near food if I look this bad."

    "It may be time to sell my earrings for food. If they take earrings as payment still."

    "That’s what pirates have them for, but I’ve never heard a story of anyone actually using them to get emergency funds."

    "If silver hasn’t gone down in price, at least one of my studs should get me a sandwich."
