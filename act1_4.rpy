"Coming out of the school the sun is starting to set. To see a sunset from land and not the sea is sort of, underwhelming."

"Instead of the light reflecting off the pristine water, it’s bouncing on concrete and buildings."

"The shadows of the trees are nice, but it’s just not the same."

"That trip did not go as I had planned it."

"I think I expected the {i}Admiral's son{/i} treatment from them, some pompous wannabes pretending to act like pirates."

"A group of genuine people my age who wanted to know more about me and pirates, that was a shock."

"There’s a quiet hum of the town through the trees."

"Not like before with all the people around, a sleepy days end feeling."

"I assumed that since all the people were here that this place would never sleep."

"I belong out there, soaring on the ocean’s surface."

"Out there I’m needed and revered. Even if the whole crew doesn’t treat me like it, I know they need me."

"It’s the subtle things that keep the peace between everyone. A good deed here or there."

"Getting a second serving of food, someone cleaning your pistol without asking, the way Ol’ Two Hands makes sure I get my work done on time so that he has someone to play chess with later."

"I have people in my life who already value me, there’s little need to look towards the mainland for alternatives."

"Now that I’m an adult, opportunities might start opening up for me."

"If the Captain acknowledges it, then there could be something down the line waiting for me."

"One day I could have my own crew. I could be the next Demonic Pirate Captain."

"Who knows? Let’s see what life hurls at me next."

"The next few years may be my best yet."
